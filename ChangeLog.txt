----------
		Feng Gao add one new parameter of IMQ module(3.18,4.0,and 4.1), imq_dev_accurate_stats (default is 1).
		It is used to notify if IMQ get the accurate stats. 
		When imq_dev_accurate_stats is 0, it could avoid one spin to enhance the performance.

2015-06-24
----------
		Feng Gao removed usless skb_cb_store_lock of 4.0 patch. It will be merged into other patches if it is ok.
		Fixed malformed linux-3.2-imq.diff, linux-3.10-imq.diff, linux-3.12-imq.diff

----------
		Feng Gao support for kernel 3.18 and 3.14;
		And make one enhancement for IMQ performance. It could enhance IMQ Performance about 20%.

2011/08/16:

Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING flag that was added for linux 3.0.2

2011/07/26:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Add queue mapping checks for packets exiting IMQ.
               - Port to 3.0

2011/07/12:
-----------
syoder89@gmail.com:
               - Crash fix that happens when the receiving interface has more
                 than one queue (add missing skb_set_queue_mapping in
                 imq_select_queue).

2011/03/18:

Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.38

Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.35
               - Simplify hook registration by using nf_register_hooks.
               - nf_reinject doesn't need spinlock around it, therefore remove
                 imq_nf_reinject function. Other nf_reinject users protect
                 their own data with spinlock. With IMQ however all data is
                 needed is stored per skbuff, so no locking is needed.
               - Changed IMQ to use 'separate' NF_IMQ_QUEUE instead of
                 NF_QUEUE, this allows working coexistance of IMQ and other
                 NF_QUEUE users.
               - Make IMQ multi-queue. Number of IMQ device queues can be
                 increased with 'numqueues' module parameters. Default number
                 of queues is 1, in other words by default IMQ works as
                 single-queue device. Multi-queue selection is based on
                 IFB multi-queue patch by Changli Gao <xiaosuo@gmail.com>.

-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.32
               - Add check for skb->nf_queue_entry==NULL in imq_dev_xmit()
               - Also add better error checking for skb->nf_queue_entry usage 

 
2009/09/26:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
                - Add imq_nf_reinject_lockless to fix deadlock with
                  imq_nf_queue/imq_nf_reinject.

 
2009/04/20:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
                - Use netdevice feature flags to avoid extra packet handling
                  by core networking layer and possibly increase performance.

Jussi Kivilinna:
                - 2.6.27 and newer overwrite control buffer. 
                - Add skb_save_cb/skb_restore_cb helper functions for backuping
                  control buffer. This is needed because qdisc-layer on kernels
                - Add better locking for IMQ device. Hopefully this will solve SMP issues. 
                - Port to 2.6.27
                - Port to 2.6.28
                - Port to 2.6.29 + fix rmmod not working


2008/08/06:
-----------
        2.6.26 - (JK)
               - Replaced tasklet with 'netif_schedule()'.
               - Cleaned up and added comments for imq_nf_queue().


2008/06/17:
-----------
        2.6.25 - Changed imq.c to use qdisc_run() instead of qdisc_restart() and moved 
                 qdisc_run() to tasklet to avoid recursive locking. 
                 New initialization routines to fix 'rmmod' not working anymore. Used code from ifb.c. (Jussi Kivilinna)

        IMQ versions between 2.6.7 and 2.6.13 were released with almost no problems. 
	2.6.14-x was released with some important changes: nfcache was removed.
        After some weeks of trouble we figured out that some IMQ fields in skb were missing 
        in skbuff.c - skb_clone and copy_skb_header.
        These functions are correctly patched by this new patch version.
        Thanks for all who helped to figure out all the problems with
        2.6.14.x: 
           - Patrick McHardy, Rune Kock, VeNoMouS, Max CtRiX, Kevin Shanahan, Richard Lucassen, 
             Valery Dachev (hopefully I didn't forget anybody). I apologize again for my lack of time.

       - Addition of functionality to choose how IMQ hooks on PRE and POSTROUTING (after or before NAT) (Andre Correa)
